# OpenGLClock
A virtual clock made in OpenGL for LSU's CSC 4356 course

This is a simple project done in my Interactive Computer Graphics course at LSU to introduce OpenGL and it's library functions to us.
I tried to experiment with the construction and transformation of primitive shapes to model my clock after a wristwatch. The clock itself
actually keeps time using the machine's internal clock and rotating the hands based on the internal time.
